I am a first-year Ph.D. student (expected 2028) in the Shanghai Center Systems Biomedicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am a member of the SJTU MVIG under the supervision of Prof. Cewu Lu and Prof. Jielin Sun. Prior to that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree (Software Engineering) from Zhengzhou University in 2023. My research interests mainly lie in bioinformatics and motion/action prediction under embodied environments for autonomous driving, robots and digital human.
