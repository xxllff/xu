excerpt: 'Human cognition can leverage fundamental conceptual knowledge, like geometry and joint concepts, to appropriately perceive, comprehend and interact with novel objects. Motivated by this finding, we aim to endow machine intelligence with an analogous capability through performing at the conceptual level. To achieve this goal, we propose Analytic Ontology Template (AOT), a parameterized and differentiable program description of generalized conceptual knowledge. A pipeline called AOTNet driven by AOTs is designed accordingly to equip intelligent agents with these generalized conceptual knowledge, and then empower the agents to effectively explore the structure and affordance of novel objects. The AOT-driven approach yields benefit in three key perspectives: i) enabling concept-level understanding of novel objects without relying on any real training data, ii) providing analytic structure information, and iii) introducing rich affordance information indicating proper ways of interaction. We conduct exhaustive experiments on articulated objects, which are ideal subjects due to their intricate geometric structures and diverse joint types, to better demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Due to the space limitation, please refer to our supplementary material for more details.'
